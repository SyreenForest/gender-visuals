        Countries’ levels of inclusion, justice, and security for women versus the share of women studying STEM subjects at tertiary level
    </p>

    <div class="summary">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This analysis explores the hypothesis that a higher proportion of women pursue studies in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) subjects in countries with greater gender inequality, as opposed to countries where gender equality indicators are more positive. While this may appear counter-intuitive, emerging research suggests this pattern holds true in certain contexts.
        </p>
        <p>
            To investigate this hypothesis and visually represent the relationship, the analysis draws on two key datasets: the Women, Peace, and Security Index (WPS), published by the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security, which measures women's inclusion, justice, and security; and data on the rates of women studying STEM subjects at the tertiary education level, compiled by the World Bank.

            <h2>WPS Index vs. Women in STEM</h2>
            <iframe src="fig_stem_vs_wps.html" title="Scatter Plot: WPS Index vs STEM"></iframe>
            <p class="caption">
               This scatter plot compares countries’ WPS Index scores (used here as a proxy for gender equality) with the percentage of women in STEM fields.
            </p>
            <p>
                Specifically, countries with lower WPS scores (e.g., between 0.4 and 0.6) often have higher proportions of women in STEM, with some reaching over 60%.
                In contrast, countries with higher WPS scores (closer to 0.9) typically cluster below 40%, with many even below 30%.
            </p>
            <p>
                While the trend is clear, it is not absolute as there are outliers and considerable variation among lower-scoring countries,
                suggesting other cultural, social norms, economic, or educational factors are at play. Nonetheless, the general pattern supports the hypothesis that gender equality
                and women's representation in STEM do not always move in parallel, and may in fact show an inverse relationship in some global contexts.
