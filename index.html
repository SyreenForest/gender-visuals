<p class="caption">
    The Women, Peace and Security (WPS) Index scores and ranks countries based on 13 indicators across three dimensions: inclusion, justice, and insecurity. Scores range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best outcome. <br><br>
    <strong>Inclusion</strong> is measured by 5 indicators: women’s achievements in education, employment, and parliamentary representation, as well as access to cell phones and financial services. <br>
    <strong>Justice</strong> is measured by 4 indicators: the absence of legal discrimination against women, access to justice, maternal mortality, and bias in favor of sons. <br>
    <strong>Security</strong> is measured by 4 indicators: intimate partner violence, perceptions of community safety, political violence targeting women, and the share of women who live near armed conflict. <br><br>
